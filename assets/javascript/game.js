 //  ---------java script---------

 //    when the webpage loads, need to make a random number populate as the "Winning Number". this number generate inbetween the numbers 19 and 120
 

 //when page loads, wins/losses and "total score" will all be set to 0

 // each jewel will need to store a different random number in it. the random jewel number will generate inbetween 1 and 12


 //when someone clicks on the random jewel, the number will be populated in the total score div. (if there is already a number in the "total score", then the new number will be added to the "total score".)


// if the "total score" goes beyong the "Winning Number", then the player loses and losses will go up by 1, "winning number" will generate a new random number inbetween 19-120, the "total score" will be set back to 0, and the jewels will all reset to new random numbers inbetween 1-12.

//if the "total score" matches the "winning number",  then the player wins and win's will go up by 1, "winning number" will generate a new random number inbetween 19-120, the "total score" will be set back to 0, and the jewels will all reset to new random numbers inbetween 1-12.
